# Wordle 
It is a word gamewhere players have six attempts to guess a five-letter word. 
The game provides feedback in the form of colored tiles for each guess, indicating how close the guess is to the word of the day.

## Game rule:
Each guess must be a valid word in the game's dictionary. After submitting a guess, the tiles will change color to show how accurate the guess was.
-Green Tile: The letter is in the correct position.
-Yellow Tile: The letter is in the word but in the wrong position.
-Gray Tile: The letter is not in the word at all.
